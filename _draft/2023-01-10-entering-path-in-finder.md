title: "Entering path in Mac Finder"

As a developer, you might have a file path in clipboard 
(e.g. `/Users/hotternative/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/PyCharm2021.2/scratches/scratch_1.json`) 
and you'd like to open it with a software of your choice.

When the path is long, it's a hassle to navigate in the finder to reach the file.
Finder has a shortcut Command + Shift + g which opens a hidden window and allows the path to be put in directly.
