title: "Set up git-crypt to store sensitive information for a large engineering team"

After the initial set-ups in [the previous post]({% post_url 2022-11-22-use-git-crypt-to-store-sensitive-information %}),
say you have a file `sample.secrets` that contains some secrets you'd like to push to git.

## Register the file to be encrypted
This is to be done by a power-user or admin of the repository.

First, register this file in `.gitattributes` by adding a line, e.g.:
```
sample.secrets filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```
Note, it's possible to specify a file pattern, e.g.
```
*.secrets filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```
or relevant path from the `.gitattributes` file, e.g.
```
path/to/prod.secrets filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt
```
## Generate a new gpg key pair 
Say we now want to add a new engineer who is supposed to able to see
this encrypted file. The new engineer needs to run 
```shell
gpg --default-new-key-algo rsa3072 --full-generate-key
```
Then select Option 1 and follow the steps to generate the key pair. 
An email address and a name are required to generate the key pair.

The new engineer needs to take a note of the key file name, which looks like
`A49C7704A9C63894C75937897A4548F83C86403D`

Once the key pair is generated, obtain the public key by 
```
gpg --export -a <email_aaddress_supplied_when_generating_the_key_pair>
```
The new engineer will need to share the public key and the file name to an authroised 
user or an admin of the repo.

## Structure of the keys
Say you have a staging environment and a production environment, create a structure like this in your repo:
![example](/assets/git-crypt-structure.png)

## Add a new user

This needs to be done by an existing git-crypt user or an admin of the repo.
The admin shall create a new key file 
```shell
touch <key_file_name>.gpg
```
Save the public key into the file just created.

Import GPG public key:
```shell
gpg --import <key_file_name>.gpg
```

Say the user is entitled to view and edit secrets in the staging environment.
```shell
git-crypt add-gpg-user <key_file_name>
```
where the key_file_name is generated by the new engineer and shared with the admin.

```shell

git-crypt export-key ../git-crypt-key
```
