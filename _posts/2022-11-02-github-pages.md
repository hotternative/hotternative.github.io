The official [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)
is long-winded. The essential steps are:

1. Type a name for your repository and an optional description. 
If you're creating a user or organization site, 
your repository must be named <user>.github.io or <organization>.github.io. 
If your user or organization name contains uppercase letters, you must lowercase the letters.
