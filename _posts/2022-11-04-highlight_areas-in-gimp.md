In Windows Paint, it's easy to highlight certain areas of a picture. In GIMP, we can do the same by:
1. Tools -> Selection Tools -> Rectangle Select (keyboard shortcut R) (or another select that best suited to the area to be highlighted)
2. Select with mouse, use Shift to select multiple areas
3. Select -> Invert to choose the areas that are not currently selected. We will dim these areas so that the previously
selected areas are highlighted
4. Choose the Bucket Fill tool (or Shift B). Choose FG colour fill and reduce the Opacity to about 50%.
5. To actually fill, click anywhere in the areas to be dimmed.
6. If unhappy with the result, press Ctrl + Z to undo.
