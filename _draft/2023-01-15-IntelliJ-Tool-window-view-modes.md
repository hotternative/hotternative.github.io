In IntelliJ there are multiple options regarding "View Modes"

What are the differences between these options?

First of all, in this blog, a "window" means an area in IntelliJ like "Project", "Terminal", "Database", etc.

* "Dock" means the window occupies a fixed area in the screen, 
and other windows have to make some room for it.

* "Pinned" means the window doesn't disappear automatically if the focus is moved away from the window.

* In the "Undock" mode, the window still occupies a fixed area in the screen, **but other windows do not have to make some room for it.**
How is it possible if other windows do not have to reduce their area? The undocked window simply stays where it is and covers other windows!
Undock mode is unpinned - it will disappear automatcally if the focus is moved to other windows.

* Float and Window modes are self-explanatory.  

Jetbrains has got some nice video clips to explain the differences:
